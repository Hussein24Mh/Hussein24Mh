# Hi There!
**I** am that **"Algorithms, Data structure"** lover , In past I was always looking up for those problem-solving problems to imply my **Logical Thinking** and **Code Skills** on them 

**Then** I went further by learning the **Data Science** field
started by advancing my **Python** and **SQL** knowledge,
followed some **Statistics**, **Probability**, and **Mathematics**

**Now** I am learning **Machine learning** and **Deep learning Algorithms**
